Hello World!
Piyush is engineering undergrad at NIT Kurukshetra. He's currently in his junior year.
He likes working on embedded projects and web development projects in his free time.
He has worked with languages like Cpp, JS, Python, and SQL, and has also worked on several Full-Stack projects.

Piyush also claims to be fluent in writing Assembly code, as it was included in his college course, but can only write small recursive codes at best.
He thinks he is funny, and always tries to crack unfunny jokes (like the one above). Something else that he always try, is to avoid doing his college's club work.

Anyways, Piyush says hi.
