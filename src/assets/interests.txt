Piyush is a simple being. Anything involving a microprocessor interests Piyush. In his free time, he likes to work on embedded projects or development projects. Also, he likes solving DS problems. Recently, he's been working on creating custom Gnome themes and extensions for Ubuntu, just like he did for his rooted chinese phone from 2014.

Also, he likes watching anime, and sketching their characters on his dragonfly, but most of them just look like random polygons.
